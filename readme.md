# Node Fastify Architecture

A boilerplate/starter project for quickly building RESTful APIs using Node.js, Fastify, and Prisma.

It incorporates the latest technologies, such as `pnpm` for package management, `jest` for test cases, and `eslint` for enforcing coding guidelines and best practices.

By running a single command, you will get a production-ready Node.js app installed and fully configured on your machine. The app comes with many built-in features, such as authentication using JWT, request validation, unit and integration tests, continuous integration, docker support, API documentation, pagination, etc. For more details, check the features list below.
